~ #TrumpedUp ~

A silly Google Chrome extension made for a friend. It replaces the Roman alphabet and numbers with a reinvented alphabet comprised of words often used by Donald Trump in his Tweets. Its execution is simple and its reach is limited, only replacing plain text (it ignores hyperlinked text, for example). 

This extension was originally forked from github.com/laurenorsini/caaaaarbs as a template but has been heavily edited. Main document traversing function provided by a user on Stack Overflow (link in code). Icons designed by the friend, Luke Bolton (lukebolton.com). 

Extension available on github.com/m-montgomery/trumped-up
